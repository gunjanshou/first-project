## Ways to commit changes
### For a developer
 - Refer the documentation of jekyll & Tailwind beforehand.
 - Make sure to add comments to the changes you made.
 - It is prefered that the changes shall be made in the existing files itself. rather creating a new one.
 - The repository has a seperate 'development' branch for you to push your changes into.
 - Further on validating your pull request your code will be merged to master.

### For a non-developer
 - Create a file under ['./_blog'](/_blog) and name it whatever you want.
 - After adding some sample content to it, make a pull request.
 - If you note any changes that you think should be made anywhere else in the repository, just make those changes and make  your pull request and state the change in the commit description you made, it would be much appreciated.
 - The repository has a seperate 'documentation' branch for you to push your changes into.
 - Further on validating your pull request your code will be merged to master.
